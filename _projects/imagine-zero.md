We were excited to work with [Imagine Zero](http://imaginezerosuicide.org) for the first Shattering the Silence: Self Care Fair taking place in Downtown Fort Collins. The event is aimed at LGBTQ youth age 13-17 with the goal of exploring new ways to practice self care. We designed and built a jekyll based website for the team to manage their programming schedule and marketing materials.

De-stigmitizing mental health issues and providing resources for those in need is a cause that is near and dear to both of us and we were glad to be able to help.
