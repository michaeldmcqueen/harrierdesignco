"This is how it's always been... This is how we do things in the country!" 

We got the opportunity, to create a poster for Slim Cessna's show at the Downtown Artery. Being fans of their live shows it was fun to work on this project Jumped into the project and worked with Ink Lab, in Denver, printed the posters. 3-color Screenprint on 200lb stock.
