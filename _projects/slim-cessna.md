<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hDRxBpyHbc" title="Slim Cessna's Auto Club - This Is How We Do Things In The Country | Glitterhouse Records" target="_blank">"This is how it's always been... This is how we do things in the country!"</a>

We got the opportunity to create a poster for Slim Cessna's show at the Downtown Artery in Fort Collins. Being fans of their electric live shows it was a fun project to work on.  

Artwork for the band tends to be dark southern gothic, so we experimented with a brighter color pallete while still holding onto some of those darker overtones in the illustration.

We worked with <a href="http://www.inklounge.com/" title="Ink Lounge Website" target="_blank">Ink Lounge</a> in Denver to screenprint the posters.
