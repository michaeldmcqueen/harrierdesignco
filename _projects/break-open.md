In 2015 Caitlin set out to create a way to break down the stigma surrounding mental health in the community. This idea took off into a 2 day festival hosted at the Downtown Artery and the Lyric Cinema Cafe in Downtown Fort Collins, Colorado. Combining arts and film with panels, interactive courses and workshops, the event was able to touch 350+ members of the community.

Caitlin worked to bring onboard collaborators and sponsors including UC Health, SummitStone and Alliance for Suicide Prevention.

We worked to create the branding, website, and all festival materials as well as the event production and logistics of the festival itself.
