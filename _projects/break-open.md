In 2015 Caitlin set out to create a way to break down the stigma surrounding mental health. This idea took off into a 2 day festival hosted at the Downtown Artery and the Lyric Cinema Cafe in Downtown Fort Collins. Bridging arts and film, with panels, interactive courses and workshops, the event was able to touch 300+ members of the community.

Caitlin worked to bring aboard collaborators and sponsors including UC Health, Summit Stone, Alliance for Suicide Prevention, etc.

We worked to create the branding, website, and festival materials as well as the event production and logistics of the festival itself.
