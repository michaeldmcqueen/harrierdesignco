I worked with Group Cares in a Digital Experience Manager position, responsible for designing, developing, and implementing innovative digital solutions to every web experience based on metrics, branding guidelines, and best customer experience. Responsibilities including platform selection, wireframing and design, development, marketing support, and back-office integration.

Highlighted below is the main customer facing website that I rebuilt in Drupal 8 moving away from Umbraco CMS. Major issues with the existing site and platform were flexibility when building new features and updates (this relied on a external team to manage), SEO and Performance as well as the need to incorporate new branding.

The rebuild was a major success. SEO issues had been monitored in MOZ Pro, which reported over 4000 issues, from metadata, redirects to accessibility, post launch the number of issues is below 100 and dropping.

Performance was hugely upgraded from in single digits in Lighthouse to consistently in the mid-90s.
