Ginger & Baker is home to a market, bakery, restaurants, teaching kitchen, event spaces and some of the best patios in town, located in the historic renovated grain mill in Downtown Fort Collins it's a truly special spot.

We worked with Ginger &amp; Bakerâ€™s team on their existing Wordpress CMS, upgrading, adding new features, and continually improving performance, design and user experience. This lead to a new a redesign of the current site to reflect the atmosphere and quality of the space. During the time we've worked with G&B we've built new features such as an Online Store so they can sell pies and other goods for shipping and local pickup, a Job Board for open positions and applications.
